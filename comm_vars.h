! This following common block contains a set of globally accessable
! variables in order to allow information exchange between parallel
! threads working on different subdomains.
!
! Global summation variables are declared with 16 byte precision
! to avoid accumulation of roundoff errors, since roundoff  error
! depends on the order of summation, which is undeterministic in
! the case of summation between the parallel threads; not doing so
! would make itimpossible to pass an ETALON CHECK test if there is
! a feedback of these sums into the dynamics of the model, such as
! in the case when global mass conservation is enforced.

! One sunny sping day, somewhen in 1989 an american tourist, who
! happened to be an attorney, was walking along a Moscow street.
! Because it was the period of 'Perestroika' (which literally means
! 'remodelling'), so that a lot of construction was going on in
! Moscow, dozens of holes and trenches were open on the street. He
! felt into one of them, broke his leg, ended up in a hospital and
! complaining: In my country if a construction firm would not place
! little red flags around the construction zone to warn passers-by
! about the danger, I will sue em for their negligence! The doctror,
! who was performing surgery on his leg replied to him: Did not you
! see the one big red flag above the whole country at the first time?

! WARNING: FRAGILE ALIGNMENT SEQUENCE: In the following common block:
! since real objects are grouped in pairs and integer*4 are grouped
! in quartets, it is guaranteed that 16 Byte objects are aligned
! in 16 Byte boundaries and 8 Byte objects are aligned in 8 Byte
! boundaries. Removing or introduction of variables with violation
! of parity, as well as changing the sequence of variables in the
! common block may cause violation of alignment.
